# ketchupstatus
Displays the status of your office's community ketchup.

## Background
In our office Monday is chicken & fries day. And we always have a bottle
of ketchup which we share. However before buying groceries in the supermarket
next door, we always forget to check if we have enough ketchup left.

So I quickly threw together a simple sinatra web app to set and check the
status.
